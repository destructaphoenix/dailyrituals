# Daily Rituals — Build Progress (live cursor)

> **The memory between chats. Read top-to-bottom every chat — and keep it SMALL.** This file is only:
> the backlog table, any **open** IMP spec(s), live blockers, and the **2 newest** session notes.
>
> - Stable reference (locked decisions, release + signing rules, parked phases 8/10b/11, config, architecture) → [`docs/playbook.md`](docs/playbook.md) — open only when you need it.
> - Finished IMP specs + older session notes → [`docs/build-log.md`](docs/build-log.md). Git is the full record.
> - How to drive a Sonnet chat → [`DEVGUIDE.md`](DEVGUIDE.md).
>
> **Size budget (hard rule):** the moment an IMP task is **code-complete** (don't wait for ship / runtime-walk), MOVE its full block to [`docs/build-log.md`](docs/build-log.md) and leave only its one-line row in the backlog table. If you ever see a ✅ task's full spec still inline here, archive it **before** committing. This is what keeps the file from bloating.

## ▶️ ACTIVE TRACK

The live work is the **first unchecked `IMP-xxx` task in the Improvements backlog** below — its full spec is inline (Opus scopes it there; no separate plan file). Work that, **not** the phase ladder (8 / 10b / 11), which is **parked in [`docs/playbook.md`](docs/playbook.md)** until the owner resumes it.

**App status:** in Play **closed testing** — gated by the 12-testers × 14-continuous-days requirement (see Blockers). Free public launch (10a) unlocks when that clears.

---

## 🔧 Improvements backlog (post-launch — ACTIVE TRACK)

Opus scopes each owner-filed issue into a numbered `IMP-xxx` task (steps + commit message + ship lane all inline). Sonnet picks the **first unchecked** one, executes its steps in order, commits with the given message, ticks the boxes, archives the finished spec, and writes the Last session note.

| ID | Title | Lane | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## 📋 IMP-022 (OPEN SPEC) — wire the two dead You-tab buttons

**Problem (owner-found).** Two rows in the **General** card of [`src/screens/YouScreen.js`](src/screens/YouScreen.js) render full UI but do nothing — their `onPress` is an empty `() => {}`:
1. **"Save as PDF"** (line ~148–160) — for a **Plus** user it runs a no-op; non-Plus correctly routes to the paywall. There is **no PDF code anywhere** (no `expo-print` in `package.json`; the only "PDF" string in `data.js` is marketing copy). The UI (icon, "Plus" badge, paywall gate, chevron) was built but the export was never implemented.
2. **"About Daily Rituals"** (line ~162–163, shows `v1.0`) — `onPress={() => {}}`; opens nothing.

**Goal.** Make both buttons actually work, keeping every existing gate/style intact. **Two parts, one task** — Part A needs a new native module so the whole task is **BUILD lane**; Part B is JS-only but ships in the same shipment.

### Part A — Save as PDF (Plus-gated keepsake export)
- Add **`expo-print`** dependency (new native module → forces a dev build; `expo-sharing` + `expo-file-system` already vendored by IMP-020, reuse them).
- **Pure core first (TDD):** new `src/export/pdf.js` → `buildKeepsakeHtml(entries, meta)` returning a self-contained HTML string (inline styles, no network assets) — title page + chronological entries (real device dates, same date helpers as `src/insights/dateKeys.js`), empty-state when no entries. Unit-test the builder (entry rendering, ordering, escaping of user text, empty state). **This is the single tested boundary** — mirror the `src/backup/` shape.
- **Thin native wrapper:** `src/export/io.js` → `exportPdf()` = `Print.printToFileAsync({ html })` → `Sharing.shareAsync(uri)`. Lazy-require natives + reuse IMP-020's typed `nativeUnavailable` pattern so **Expo Go shows the toast** instead of crashing (see `src/backup/io.js` for the exact pattern after the 5e7132c revert).
- **Wire-up:** in `YouScreen.js` replace the `plus ? () => {}` branch with `plus ? onExportPdf : …` (keep `plusEnabled ? onOpenPaywall : undefined` untouched). Thread `onExportPdf` from `RitualsApp.js` (build HTML from real entries + call `io.exportPdf`), with the same try/catch + toast wiring `doExport`/`doImport` use.
- **Do not** change the paywall path, the "Plus" badge, or non-Plus behavior.

### Part B — About Daily Rituals
- Replace its `onPress={() => {}}` with a real **About** sheet/modal (a small new component, OTA-able on its own): app name + tagline, **version pulled from `expo-application` / `Constants.expoConfig.version`** (kill the hardcoded `v1.0`), a one-line "Your journal lives only on this device" local-first note (consistent with the local-only decision), and a credits/“made by” line. No external links unless trivial.
- Keep it a presentational component fed by props; no new persistence.

### Steps
1. RED: `__tests__/export/pdf.test.js` for `buildKeepsakeHtml` (entries, order, escaping, empty). 2. GREEN: `src/export/pdf.js`. 3. `src/export/io.js` thin native wrapper (lazy-require + `nativeUnavailable` toast). 4. `RitualsApp.js` → `onExportPdf` handler + try/catch/toast; pass into `YouScreen`. 5. `YouScreen.js` → wire Part A onPress; build + wire **About** component for Part B (version from `Constants`). 6. `npm test` green; `npx expo export --platform android` clean. 7. `npm install expo-print`; `npm run bump:build` (versionCode bump). 8. Commit.

**Commit message:** `feat(you): implement Save as PDF export + About sheet — wire the two no-op You-tab buttons (IMP-022)`

**Ship lane:** **BUILD** (new `expo-print` native module). Rides the **same dev build as IMP-006 / IMP-020** — no `Release-Lane` trailer until owner says ship. Smoke test after build: Plus user PDF export → share sheet opens → file opens; non-Plus still hits paywall; Expo Go shows the unavailable toast; About sheet opens with the real version string.

## Open items / blockers

- **⏳ CURRENT BLOCKER (Phase 10a.6):** Free release is in Play review; production publish is gated by the **closed-testing 12×14 requirement** (12 testers continuously opted in for 14 days). Owner recruiting testers since 2026-06-06 — nothing to code, purely a Play Console / community process. Production unlocks ≈ 14 days after 12 testers are continuously in. When back, owner may bring **bug fixes / improvements** rather than continuing the phase ladder.
- **IMP-006 (Android Auto Backup):** code done; needs **owner device verification** of the backup → uninstall → reinstall → restore cycle + a Play data-safety confirm. Rides the v5 build. (Steps in build-log.)
- **IMP-020 (Backup / Restore):** code-complete + unit-tested + bundles clean; needs the **owner device/emulator smoke test** (export → save → restore → recovery copy; non-backup-file error toast; settings deep-link). BUILD lane — rides the same build as IMP-006; no ship trailer applied yet.
- **IMP-021 (Lifetime Progress):** code-complete; OTA lane — no ship trailer applied. Owner decides when to push. Manual smoke test pending (owner-device: empty state; 1-entry heatmap; multi-week heatmap; "Your patterns" heading; no "Days kept"/"This month" tiles).
- **iOS (Phase 11):** ⛔ blocked on a Mac / EAS macOS + Apple Developer Program enrollment. Phase 6 iOS real-billing row is blocked on the same.

## Last session note

_History archived in [`docs/build-log.md`](docs/build-log.md) → "Session notes". Only the two newest notes stay here; every chat moves the older one out when it appends a new one (see DEVGUIDE Step 4)._

_2026-06-14 — IMP-021 COMPLETE (code-complete; OTA lane; no ship trailer). Lifetime Progress — second piece of the "legacy" roadmap (A+B). 4 commits, TDD-first. New pure modules: `src/insights/dateKeys.js` (shared `longestConsecutiveRun`/`dayKeyToUtcMs`/`DAY_MS`, extracted from `derive.js`); `src/insights/lifetime.js` (`deriveLifetime` — days remembered, total words, streaks, level/XP, adaptive `activeSpan` label). `buildLifetimeHeatmap` appended to `src/home/calendar.js` (Monday-first week rows from first entry → today). `InsightsScreen.js` restructured: "Your record" section (hero number + 2×2 totals grid + adaptive consistency heatmap) above "Your patterns" heading (unchanged mood mix + rhythm); old "Days kept"/"This month" tiles removed; subtitle updated. `xp` piped from `RitualsApp.js`. `npm test` → **190 passed, 25 suites** (3 new suites: dateKeys 4 tests, lifetime 11, calendar +4 = 20 total). Commits b347dd3…a0d5446. NEXT: owner smoke test (empty state; 1-entry heatmap; multi-week heatmap; "Your patterns" visible) — no ship until owner says go. Then **C — Annual Recap / Time Capsule** (folds in the deferred milestone timeline)._

_2026-06-14 — IMP-023 COMPLETE (code-complete; OTA lane; no ship trailer). Dynamic daily text — owner wanted the app to stay fully offline but have the greeting + some text vary daily. Brainstormed (visual companion) → scoped to **two offline rotating slots**: (1) **multilingual hello headline** — stateless date-seeded pick from `HELLOS` ×16; English time-of-day ("Good morning") demoted to the subtitle by the date; header rebuilt as **Layout A** (utility row w/ EmberPill+toggle on top, full-width greeting below) to fix the long-hello-vs-cluster crowding; (2) **daily reflection prompt** in the write card (only when `!done`; auto-hides at "Today is at rest.") via a persisted **no-repeat deck** (`promptDeck`) over `PROMPTS` ×60 (≈2-month recycle). New pure modules `src/time/dailyPick.js`, `src/content/{greetings,prompts,deck}.js` (all TDD'd); `promptDeck` added to `PERSISTED_KEYS` (no migration); `RitualsApp.js` computes+persists the deck and passes `dailyPrompt`; `HomeScreen.js` header+card. All new UI uses theme tokens (day/night/nightV2 + accent safe). `npm test` → **218 passed, 29 suites** (4 new suites). `npx expo export --platform android` bundles clean (exit 0). 7 commits f7ae548…5f686f8 (spec 6af3215), merged to main (fast-forward). Full spec archived to build-log. NEXT: owner manual smoke test (header both modes + custom accent; greeting/prompt stable within a day; prompt rotates daily no early repeats; auto-hide when done). No ship until owner says go._
