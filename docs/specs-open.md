# Open IMP specs — the build queue

> **What this file is.** The full spec for every **open** `IMP-xxx` task. [`PROGRESS.md`](../PROGRESS.md) keeps the
> backlog table, the live blockers and the two newest session notes; it points here for the spec body.
> Finished specs move to [`docs/build-log.md`](build-log.md). Git is the full record.
>
> **How Sonnet uses this file — read ONE spec, not the file.** `PROGRESS.md`'s backlog table names the
> first unchecked task and links to its heading here. **Open that heading only.** Every other spec in this
> file is for a different chat and reading it is wasted context.
>
> **These specs are the design.** Opus decided every open question in them — file paths, function
> signatures, copy strings, the free/Plus line. Execute the Steps in order. **Do not redesign, do not
> re-litigate a "why", and do not improve the scope.** If a step turns out to be impossible or the code
> contradicts the spec, **STOP** and log it to `PROGRESS.md` → Open items rather than inventing a fix.
>
> **Every spec ends the same way:** `npm test` green (must stay ≥ the prior count, currently **1205 passed, 110 suites** — verified 2026-09-12), `npx expo export --platform android` clean, commit with the **exact** message given, then
> update `PROGRESS.md` (tick the backlog row, write the session note) and **move the finished spec from
> this file into `docs/build-log.md`**.
>
> **Ship trailer:** only add `Release-Lane: ota` / `Release-Lane: build` when the owner asked you to
> release. No trailer = committed but not shipped, which is the normal end state.

## The queue

| Row | What | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [IMP-122](#imp-122--the-sky-catalogue-becomes-a-manifest) | `SHOP_SKIES` knows five gradient `kind` strings. Make a sky a manifest (clip URL, poster, mode pair, accent) and feed the shop tiles from it. **Pure JS — OTA.** | ⬜ **open — take this one** (IMP-121 done, commit `d0fe2cb`) |

**IMP-120 is done** — archived in [`docs/build-log.md`](build-log.md#imp-120--the-consistency-grid-becomes-a-bounded-month-strip-2026-09-12), commit `72b0049`.
**IMP-119 is done** — archived in [`docs/build-log.md`](build-log.md#imp-119-the-ember-pills--lost-the-line-that-centred-it-2026-09-11), commit `1fc0664`.
**IMP-118 is done** — archived in [`docs/build-log.md`](build-log.md#imp-118-a-tied-weekday-no-longer-draws-as-an-empty-bar-2026-09-11), commit `dc22e32`.

**The owner asked for the Plus purchase surface to be investigated hard after IMP-099.** It was, by reading
the shipped SDK rather than our assumptions about it, and **the audit found a defect larger than IMP-099**.
**Three more rows came out of the WALK-19 re-run on 2026-09-08 (hardware, owner-run)**, and all three were
re-scoped the same day by reading source rather than trusting the field report. **Two of the three moved:
IMP-103 is not a defect at all, and IMP-104 no longer needs the device dump it asked for.** The
investigation also opened IMP-106, now code-complete and archived.

| Row | What | Severity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IMP-100 | Every RevenueCat purchase error becomes `failed`. `e.code` is a **number**, our mapper matches **names**. | ✅ **done — archived in `docs/build-log.md`** |
| IMP-101 | The `failed` card claims "you weren't charged" and never asks the store. | ✅ **done — archived in `docs/build-log.md`** |
| IMP-102 | Completing a purchase grants **+3 freezes every time**, not once. | ✅ **done — archived in `docs/build-log.md`** |
| IMP-103 | Step 4e failed on a bundle without IMP-100/101 — **neither was ever pushed or shipped**. | ✅ **done — shipped 2026-09-10, group `f961b427`; archived in `docs/build-log.md`** |
| IMP-104 | `tier: 'owned'` means free and `Shop.js` never reads it — and tapping such an item **wipes the ember balance to 0**. | ✅ **done — archived in `docs/build-log.md`** |
| IMP-105 | 🚦 Reinstall + Restore said "Nothing to restore." **The test subscription had expired mid-walk; the app was innocent.** | ✅ **CLOSED 2026-09-10 by WALK-19a — not reproducible, walk-protocol defect. Archived in `docs/build-log.md`** |
| IMP-106 | A healthy build cannot say which JS bundle it is running — the gap that mis-scoped IMP-103. | ✅ **done — archived in `docs/build-log.md`** |
| IMP-107 | A lapsed member kept Plus until they happened to background the app — no launch-time downgrade check. | ✅ **done — archived in `docs/build-log.md`** |

### ✅ Embers for money — DONE, IMP-113 is code-complete

Both gating questions were answered by the owner on 2026-09-10 (cash → embers → candles; auto-freeze stays
free) and the candle cap was set at 3, so the conversation became a spec — now built and archived in
[`docs/build-log.md`](build-log.md) → "IMP-113". **The economics, the streak-integrity argument and the
three findings that shaped it are preserved there too**, under "The embers-for-money conversation".
⚠️ **`EMBER_PACKS_ENABLED` still must not be flipped** — IMP-113 is built but not walked; it owes a new
`WALK-20` on hardware with the license tester before the flag can flip.

### Numbers that must not be reused

- **079** — used on 2026-09-05 for a baseline-capture path written, reviewed and deleted in the same
  session. Nothing landed under it, but the note naming `IMP-079` is still in the log, so reusing the
  number would make that note read as though it described a different spec.
- **057** — reserved for the historical `dayKey` migration IMP-056 deferred. It cannot be written until a
  real device's numbers come back from the dev-panel Inspector's "Data health" reporter IMP-056 added.

### ✅ The branch rule is OVER — `main` is the lane now

Superseded 2026-09-08: `feat/design-push` fast-forwarded onto `main` and the owner pushed it (`cb3d60e`).
**Commit normally, push to `main`, and add a `Release-Lane:` trailer only when the owner asks to ship.**
CI (`release.yml`) then owns the test gate, the native-file backstop, the billing preflight and
`--environment production`. ⚠️ **Never run `eas update` by hand** — that is what the trailer is for.

### The rules the next spec inherits

**Every spec here is code-complete at green tests. None of them ends in a walk.** A build chat and a
runtime walk are **two different tasks for two different chats** — where a feature needs runtime proof,
the spec's last step names its `WALK-nn` row in [`walk-open.md`](walk-open.md). **Do not run a walk from a
build chat**, and do not read a missing walk as an unfinished spec. IMP-077 is the newest worked example:
it ended code-complete at 873 green tests, and **its green suite proves nothing about the motion** — the
Reanimated jest mock no-ops every hook. WALK-18 settles it.

---

### ⏸ Parked: apply the motion vocabulary — owner's (c), deferred 2026-09-10

**Owner: *"some time later when plus is complete I can work on the motion."* NOT A ROW YET. Do not open a
number for it and do not start it — Plus is not complete.** [IMP-111](build-log.md) (removing `ScreenFade`)
is done — archived in `docs/build-log.md`.

**Why it exists.** IMP-077 bought a motion vocabulary and the app never spent it. **Six exports have no
consumer**: `riseIn`, `popIn`, `fadeOut`, `stagger`, `useCountUp`, and `ScreenFade` (IMP-111 deleted it
rather than fixing it). Only `usePressScale` is live — a 0.99 press scale deliberately built to be
imperceptible. ⚠️ **That vocabulary was not free:** IMP-077 added `react-native-reanimated` and
`react-native-worklets` as **native** deps and forced the vc14 build. **This parked row is the only thing
that ever makes that cost worth paying.**

⚠️ **`stagger` is unused — do not be fooled by `Animated.stagger` in
[`Celebration.js:23`](../src/screens/Celebration.js#L23).** That is React Native's own `Animated` API, a
different function entirely. An audit on 2026-09-10 initially miscounted it as a consumer.

**Where to start when it unparks.** `riseIn` on cards and rows is the default entrance the module was
written around; `popIn` on rewards and badges is generalized from `Celebration.js`, which is the house
motion. ⚠️ **`art.js`, `Celebration.js` and `Toast.js` stay on the RN `Animated` API — coexistence is the
design, not a compromise. Do not port them** ([`motion.js:16`](../src/motion.js#L16)).

**The gate.** "Plus is complete" is the owner's phrase and the owner's call. At minimum that means the
open Plus rows (IMP-108, IMP-109, IMP-110) shipped and WALK-19 finished.

## IMP-122 — the sky catalogue becomes a manifest

**Stage 5 of [`skies-route.md`](skies-route.md).** Pure JS on top of IMP-121, so this one **ships OTA**.

### What exists now

[`data.js:141`](../src/data.js#L141) — `SHOP_SKIES` is five entries with a `kind` string, and
[`shopui.js:92`](../src/shopui.js#L92) `SkyPreview` maps each `kind` to a two-stop gradient and an icon.
Nothing anywhere holds a URL.

### Steps

1. **`SHOP_SKIES` gains, per sky:** `clip` (URL) or `clipDay`/`clipNight` for a two-clip sky, `poster`,
   `accent` (the XP-bar colour), and `credit` — the provenance line (tool/licence + date). ⚠️ **`credit` is
   required and non-empty for every sky with a URL.** A sky whose origin nobody can state does not ship;
   add a test that asserts it.
2. **Base URL in one constant**, not per row — see the host decision in
   [`skies-route.md`](skies-route.md). One sky is `${SKY_BASE}/${id}.mp4`.
3. **Ownership, not Plus, is the gate.** `Harvest Moon` is ember-priced at 300, **not** `tier: 'plus'`
   ([`data.js:144`](../src/data.js#L144)), so the player keys on `ownedSkies` / `activeSky`. Never on
   `plus`.
4. **Mode.** A one-clip sky plays the same file in both app modes; a two-clip sky picks on `mode`.
   ⛔ Do not tint one clip to fake the other.
5. **Cache size once at startup** — `setVideoCacheSizeAsync()` in the app's existing init path, sized to
   the catalogue (~128MB), not left at the 1GB default.
6. **`SkyPreview` keeps drawing gradients for the static skies** and shows the **poster** for video skies.
   💡 **Posters in the list, the clip only in the detail sheet** — `shop-plus-skins.html` plays six live
   clips at 58×58 and flags its own cost as its one open question. This is the answer: the detail sheet
   *is* the hero card, so it reuses `SkyHero` from IMP-121 rather than adding a component.
7. Tests: every video sky has a non-empty `credit`; a two-clip sky returns different sources per mode; an
   unowned sky never resolves a URL.

### Done when

`npm test` green, export clean, commit:

```
feat(shop): a sky is a manifest, not a gradient (IMP-122)
```
