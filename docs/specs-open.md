## The queue

**One row is open.** IMP-131, IMP-132 and IMP-133 (the sunburst regressions) are done, shipped and proven
on hardware ([WALK-24](walk-open.md) closed ✅ 2026-09-14); IMP-128 stays owner-gated.

| Row | What | Lane | Take it? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **IMP-134** | **The design system has to say what the app actually draws** — the frozen card renders the rays at defaults the app stopped passing three fixes ago | **tooling** (ships nothing to users) | ✅ **TAKE THIS ONE** |
| IMP-128 | Apply the motion vocabulary — `riseIn` on cards and rows, `popIn` on badges, `useCountUp` on the streak | OTA | ⏸ **owner's yes first — do not start** |

**IMP-124 through IMP-133 are done** (archived to `docs/build-log.md`, commits `87771c4`, `d57dc2d`,

### IMP-134 — the design system has to say what the app actually draws

**Severity 🎨 · Lane: tooling — this ships nothing to a user.** No app behaviour changes, no OTA, no build.
The deliverable is that `design-system/` stops describing a version of the art the app abandoned, and that
a test makes it impossible for that to happen again.

**The defect, in one line.** [`gen-design-system.js`](../scripts/gen-design-system.js) renders the frozen
pair as `renderArt(f.C, { size: f.size }, t, f.size)` — **props: `size` only** — so both PNGs come out at
the component defaults, `focal = 80` and `reach = size / 2 = 150`. The app has passed neither of those
since IMP-132: it passes `focal = HERO_FOCAL` (168) and a `reach` derived from the hero card's diagonal
(~230dp at a 360dp window). **The card's own copy says *"each PNG is rasterised from the shipped component
with the shipped default palette, so what you see is what renders."* That sentence is now false**, and it is
the exact failure the Plus card had in September — a card describing something the app does not have.

⚠️ **Already done, 2026-09-14 — do NOT redo or revert it.** On the owner's instruction (*"I do not want
anything stale in the design system"*): all **14** baseline PNGs and both `screens/baseline-*.html` cards
are **deleted**, and `package.json`'s dead `design_handoff_plus_compliance` jest-ignore is gone. The
re-capture is [WALK-25](walk-open.md#walk-25--recapture-the-shot-set), a separate row for a separate chat.

#### Step 1 — give the hero frame one home, `src/home/heroFrame.js`

Move these five out of [`HomeScreen.js`](../src/screens/HomeScreen.js#L34) into a new pure module and
export each one: `HERO_HEIGHT` (336), `HERO_FOCAL` (`HERO_HEIGHT / 2`), `HERO_PAD` (20),
`HERO_REACH_MARGIN` (1.08) and `heroReach(windowWidth)`. `HomeScreen.js` imports them; **the comments move
with them, they are the reasoning and they are not to be summarised.** Nothing else changes — no behaviour,
no render output, and every existing hero test must pass **untouched**. If one needs editing, stop: the move
was not pure.

**Why a module and not an export from the screen:** the generator and the test both have to read these, and
importing a screen pulls the whole render tree into node for two numbers.

#### Step 2 — the frozen card renders the real composition

In `frozenPage()`:

- Pass the app's real props: `renderArt(f.C, { size: f.size, focal: HERO_FOCAL, reach: heroReach(360) }, t, ...)`.
  ⚠️ **The raster size must follow `reach`, not stay at 300** — the component builds its own `d = reach * 2`
  viewBox, so a 300px canvas would crop the disc it is supposed to be showing.
- ⚠️ **The require hook cannot place it.** [The stub](../scripts/gen-design-system.js#L52) maps every RN
  `View` to `<g>` and **drops position and size on purpose** — *"only opacity survives"* — so `top: focal -
  reach` never reaches the SVG. **Do not fight this and do not extend the stub.** Draw the relationship in
  the card's own HTML instead, which is what the file says it is for (*"this file owns layout and captions,
  never values"*): a `350 × HERO_HEIGHT` box at `t.radius.card` with `overflow:hidden`, the PNG absolutely
  positioned at `top: HERO_FOCAL - reach`, sized `reach * 2`. That is the app's geometry, expressed in the
  one language available here, with **every number imported from Step 1's module and none of them typed**.
- Rewrite the caption to state what is frozen and what is not: the 24 spokes, the colour, the 60s rotation
  and the night bloom are frozen; **`focal` and `reach` are ordinary props and a design may move and scale
  the disc.** D-15 turns on exactly that distinction, so it has to be legible here.

#### Step 3 — a capture can no longer hide its age

`baselinePages()` stays (it self-disables when no PNGs are present, which is why it emits nothing today, and
WALK-25 will refill it). Add one thing: each figure's caption prints that file's **mtime**, and the card
carries a line saying a capture older than the app is to be deleted rather than captioned. **This is the
whole reason 14 stale shots survived a month.**

#### Step 4 — the guard test

Extend [`__tests__/scripts/genDesignSystem.test.js`](../__tests__/scripts/genDesignSystem.test.js) in the
shape it already uses for the Plus card. New `describe`: **the frozen card states the geometry the app
renders.** Assert the generated `frozen/rays.html` contains the values imported from `src/home/heroFrame.js`
— **the test must not contain the literals `336`, `168` or `230`**; it computes them the way the app does,
so changing the app's geometry fails this test until the card is regenerated. Also assert the retired claim
stays retired: the card must **not** describe the rays as a 300dp disc.

**Verify red first.** Run the new `describe` against the *current* generator output before touching
`frozenPage()`; if it passes, it is asserting the wrong thing.

#### Step 5 — regenerate and commit the output

`node scripts/gen-design-system.js` (there is no npm script; do not add one), then commit the regenerated
`frozen/rays.html` and both PNGs **with** the source change. A generator commit that leaves stale output in
the tree is the same defect in a different file.

#### Done means

`npm test` green and **≥ 1249 passed, 117 suites** (the new `describe` adds cases; no existing test may
move), `npx expo export --platform android` clean, and the regenerated card committed. **Commit message,
exactly:**

```
fix(design-system): the frozen card draws the rays the app actually draws (IMP-134)
```

**No `Release-Lane:` trailer** — there is nothing to release; the app bundle is byte-identical.

⚠️ **What this row does NOT do.** It does not push to the live Claude Design project. ✅ **The live project's
own stale copies are already gone** — 63 files deleted 2026-09-14 by `DesignSync` (the 14 baselines, both
baseline cards, `scraps/`, and a duplicate of `art/brand/` sitting under `uploads/`). Pushing the *corrected*
frozen card is a separate act and belongs to whoever runs this spec, after the regeneration is committed.

✅ **`DesignSync` needs no login step — corrected 2026-09-14.** The repo previously said the owner had to run
`/design-login` first. **That is wrong and it wasted a round trip:** `/design-login` is the fallback for a
session with no claude.ai login. This session has one, so `list_projects` / `list_files` / `finalize_plan`
just work, and the only gate is the ordinary permission prompt on a write. **Do not ask the owner to log in.**


---

### IMP-128 — apply the motion vocabulary

⏸ **OWNER-GATED. Do not build this without an explicit yes, and do not take it as "the first open row".**
The gate is the owner's own, recorded 2026-09-10: *"some time later when plus is complete I can work on the
motion."* **Plus is not complete** by that sentence's own definition — WALK-19 step 8 (the one real-money
purchase) and WALK-12 (R8, must be last) are both unwalked, and WALK-20 does not have a result. **This spec
exists so the decision has a body to read when the gate lifts, not so it can be taken early.** Severity 🎨.

**What it buys, and what it already cost.** IMP-077 added a motion vocabulary and the app never spent it.
**Six of eight exports have no consumer**: `riseIn`, `popIn`, `fadeOut`, `stagger`, `useCountUp` and
`ScreenFade` (IMP-111 deleted that one rather than fixing it). Only `usePressScale` is live, at a 0.99 press
scale deliberately built to be imperceptible. **That vocabulary was not free** — IMP-077 added
`react-native-reanimated` and `react-native-worklets` as **native** deps and forced the vc14 build. **This
row is the only thing that ever makes that cost worth paying.** WALK-18's owner verdict — *"the animations
are not there"* — is the defect, and it is correct.

**Scope: three surfaces, and no more.** This is deliberately not "apply motion everywhere". It is the
smallest set that makes the app visibly move on the screens a user opens first, and it is the set the
parked note already named.

⚠️ **`art.js`, `Celebration.js` and `Toast.js` stay on the RN `Animated` API. Do not port them** —
coexistence is the stated design ([`motion.js:16`](../src/motion.js#L16)), not a compromise. ⚠️ **`stagger`
is unused — do not be fooled by `Animated.stagger` in
[`Celebration.js:23`](../src/screens/Celebration.js#L23).** That is React Native's own `Animated` API, a
different function entirely; an audit on 2026-09-10 miscounted it as a consumer.

---

#### 🔴 Read this before step 1 — four traps, all verified in source on 2026-09-13

**1. `riseIn` and `popIn` are hooks wearing function names.** Both call `useSharedValue`, `useEffect` and
`useAnimatedStyle`. They are **not** `use`-prefixed, so React's lint rule will not flag them, and calling
`riseIn(stagger(i))` inside a `.map()` callback or behind a `showRecapCard &&` guard breaks the rules of
hooks **silently**. Home's card stack is conditional in three places
([`HomeScreen.js:117`, `:128`, `:140`](../src/screens/HomeScreen.js#L117)) and Keepsakes is a `.map()`
([`Achievements.js:40`](../src/screens/Achievements.js#L40)), so **every intended call site is one of these
two shapes.** This is why step 1 introduces wrapper components instead of sprinkling calls.

**2. `motion.test.js` asserts the module's top-level bindings are exactly `['DUR', 'EASE']`**
([`__tests__/motion.test.js`](../__tests__/motion.test.js), last test, a `^(?:export )?(?:const|let|var)`
regex). **Declare the new components as `export function Rise(...)`, never `export const Rise = ...`**, or
that test goes red for a reason that has nothing to do with motion.

**3. Under jest, a `riseIn` subtree renders at `opacity: 0`.** The mock's
`useAnimatedStyle` is `IMMEDIATE_CALLBACK_INVOCATION` and `useSharedValue` returns a plain proxy, so the
style is computed once at render with `p.value` still `0`; the `useEffect` then sets it to `1` and **nothing
re-renders**, because a shared value is not React state. React Native Testing Library queries by text and
does not care about opacity, so the existing suites should pass unchanged — **but if a Home or Keepsakes
test asserts on a style object or holds a snapshot, it will move.** Expect that, and do not "fix" it by
changing the initial value.

**4. `useReducedMotion` is NOT in the Reanimated jest mock.** `node_modules/react-native-reanimated/src/mock.ts`
line 84 reads `// useReducedMotion: ADD ME IF NEEDED`. Importing it makes every suite that renders Home
throw `useReducedMotion is not a function`. **If step 5 is taken, `jest.setup.js` must extend the mock
first** — this is the exact shape of the 085/099/100 mistake (a test written against an imagined SDK), so
read the mock, do not assume it.

---

**Steps.**

1. **`src/motion.js` — add two wrapper components, nothing else.** Both are `function` declarations (trap 2),
   both render `Animated.View` from Reanimated so the animated style actually binds, and both take
   `delay`, `style` and `children`:

   ```js
   export function Rise({ delay = 0, style, children, ...rest }) {
     const a = riseIn(delay);
     return <Animated.View {...rest} style={[style, a]}>{children}</Animated.View>;
   }
   export function Pop({ delay = 0, style, children, ...rest }) { /* popIn, same shape */ }
   ```

   ⚠️ **`motion.js` is currently a `.js` file with no JSX in it.** Confirm the Babel/Metro config compiles
   JSX there (it is `babel-preset-expo` over the whole tree, so it should) by running `npm test` after this
   step alone — **before** touching a screen. If it does not, **STOP and log it**; do not move the
   components into `ui.js` on your own initiative, because `ui.js` imports theme and would break
   `motion.test.js`'s purity assertion in the other direction.
2. **Keep `motion.js` pure.** The purity test forbids imports from `persistence`, `billing`, `gamify` and
   `insights`. `react` and `react-native-reanimated` are already imported and are fine. **Do not import
   `theme` or `ui`.**
3. **`HomeScreen.js` — wrap the card stack.** Each of the card wrappers under the hero becomes
   `<Rise delay={stagger(i)}>`, in the source order they already appear: the hero card, the freeze notice,
   On this day, the Annual Recap card, the quest/write card block, the week strip, the keepsakes rail.
   ⚠️ **The index must be a literal per call site, not a running counter over conditionals** — a card that
   is absent must not shift the delays of the cards after it, or the stack re-choreographs every time a
   notice appears. Assign fixed indices 0…6 in source order and accept the gaps.
   ⚠️ **Do not wrap the hero's *contents*** — `HERO_HEIGHT` is fixed at 336dp and the video sky sits behind
   it; wrap the `Card`, not the numeral.
4. **`Achievements.js` — stagger the keepsake rows.** The `.map()` at
   [`Achievements.js:40`](../src/screens/Achievements.js#L40) wraps each row in
   `<Rise delay={stagger(i, 40)}>`. **40ms, not the 60 default** — there are enough rows that 60 finishes
   after the user has read the list, which is what `stagger`'s own comment warns about. Use `<Pop>` on the
   **earned** badge circle only (`done === true`), so an earned keepsake lands and an unearned one merely
   arrives.
5. **`useCountUp` on the streak numeral.** [`HomeScreen.js:58`](../src/screens/HomeScreen.js#L58) renders
   `{streak}` at 76pt. It becomes `useCountUp(streak)` — the hook returns a plain number in React state, so
   the existing `<T>` and every shadow style stay exactly as they are.
   ⚠️ **It animates only on *change*** (`if (from.current === value) return`), so a cold launch shows the
   real number immediately and a completed entry counts up. **That is the intended behaviour; do not
   "fix" it into a launch animation.** Leave the XP line alone this round — it is inside the same 336dp
   box and two counters in one card compete.
6. **Reduced motion — the accessibility question, and it is a real one.** ⚠️ **See trap 4.** Either extend
   the Reanimated mock in `jest.setup.js` with `useReducedMotion: () => false` **and** honour it in `Rise`
   and `Pop` (return the plain `View` with no animated style), **or do not import it at all.** Both are
   acceptable; **what is not acceptable is importing it without extending the mock.** If you take the
   no-import path, say so in the session note so the debt is recorded rather than forgotten.
7. **Tests.** Extend [`__tests__/motion.test.js`](../__tests__/motion.test.js) rather than starting a new
   suite: `Rise` and `Pop` render their children; the top-level-binding assertion still passes (trap 2);
   the purity assertion still passes (step 2). Add one render test per touched screen asserting the
   content is still **present** — that is all a no-op mock can honestly assert.

**Ship.** `npm test` green (≥ **1230 passed, 116 suites**), `npx expo export --platform android` clean, then:

```
feat(motion): the app moves — riseIn on Home and Keepsakes, popIn on earned badges (IMP-128)
```

OTA, no native change, **no `versionCode` bump** — Reanimated is already in the binary since vc14. **Do not
add a `Release-Lane` trailer** unless the owner asks.

🔴 **A green suite proves nothing about the motion here, and this row is the clearest case of that in the
project.** `jest.setup.js` no-ops every Reanimated hook and worklet — it says so in its own comment. Green
means the screens still *render* with motion wired in. **Its runtime proof is a re-run of
[WALK-18](walk-open.md#walk-18--the-app-moves), whose steps 2 and 3 were struck precisely because `riseIn`
and `stagger` had no consumer.** When this lands, **un-strike them** — they become runnable for the first
time since they were written.

**The owner asked for the Plus purchase surface to be investigated hard after IMP-099.** It was, by reading
the shipped SDK rather than our assumptions about it, and **the audit found a defect larger than IMP-099**.
**Three more rows came out of the WALK-19 re-run on 2026-09-08 (hardware, owner-run)**, and all three were
re-scoped the same day by reading source rather than trusting the field report. **Two of the three moved:
IMP-103 is not a defect at all, and IMP-104 no longer needs the device dump it asked for.** The
investigation also opened IMP-106, now code-complete and archived.

| Row | What | Severity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IMP-100 | Every RevenueCat purchase error becomes `failed`. `e.code` is a **number**, our mapper matches **names**. | ✅ **done — archived in `docs/build-log.md`** |
| IMP-101 | The `failed` card claims "you weren't charged" and never asks the store. | ✅ **done — archived in `docs/build-log.md`** |

### ✅ Embers for money — DONE, IMP-113 is code-complete

Both gating questions were answered by the owner on 2026-09-10 (cash → embers → candles; auto-freeze stays
free) and the candle cap was set at 3, so the conversation became a spec — now built and archived in
[`docs/build-log.md`](build-log.md) → "IMP-113". **The economics, the streak-integrity argument and the
three findings that shaped it are preserved there too**, under "The embers-for-money conversation".
⚠️ **`EMBER_PACKS_ENABLED` still must not be flipped** — IMP-113 is built but not walked; it owes a new
`WALK-20` on hardware with the license tester before the flag can flip.

### Numbers that must not be reused

- **079** — used on 2026-09-05 for a baseline-capture path written, reviewed and deleted in the same
  session. Nothing landed under it, but the note naming `IMP-079` is still in the log, so reusing the
  number would make that note read as though it described a different spec.
- **057** — reserved for the historical `dayKey` migration IMP-056 deferred. It cannot be written until a
  real device's numbers come back from the dev-panel Inspector's "Data health" reporter IMP-056 added.

### ✅ The branch rule is OVER — `main` is the lane now

Superseded 2026-09-08: `feat/design-push` fast-forwarded onto `main` and the owner pushed it (`cb3d60e`).
**Commit normally, push to `main`, and add a `Release-Lane:` trailer only when the owner asks to ship.**
CI (`release.yml`) then owns the test gate, the native-file backstop, the billing preflight and
`--environment production`. ⚠️ **Never run `eas update` by hand** — that is what the trailer is for.

### The rules the next spec inherits

**Every spec here is code-complete at green tests. None of them ends in a walk.** A build chat and a
runtime walk are **two different tasks for two different chats** — where a feature needs runtime proof,
the spec's last step names its `WALK-nn` row in [`walk-open.md`](walk-open.md). **Do not run a walk from a
build chat**, and do not read a missing walk as an unfinished spec. IMP-077 is the newest worked example:
it ended code-complete at 873 green tests, and **its green suite proves nothing about the motion** — the
Reanimated jest mock no-ops every hook. WALK-18 settles it.

---

### ⏸ Parked: apply the motion vocabulary — owner's (c), deferred 2026-09-10

➡️ **This is now written up as [IMP-128](#imp-128--apply-the-motion-vocabulary), and the gate is UNCHANGED.**
The owner asked on 2026-09-13 for every open suggestion in this file to be specced, and chose *"spec it,
gated"* over *"spec it, buildable"* — so a spec body now exists to read, and **a build chat still may not
take it.** The reasoning below is kept here because it is the argument for the row, not part of the row.

**Owner: *"some time later when plus is complete I can work on the motion."* Do not start it — Plus is not
complete** (WALK-19 step 8 and WALK-12 are both unwalked, and WALK-20 has no result).
[IMP-111](build-log.md) (removing `ScreenFade`) is done — archived in `docs/build-log.md`.

**Why it exists.** IMP-077 bought a motion vocabulary and the app never spent it. **Six exports have no
consumer**: `riseIn`, `popIn`, `fadeOut`, `stagger`, `useCountUp`, and `ScreenFade` (IMP-111 deleted it
rather than fixing it). Only `usePressScale` is live — a 0.99 press scale deliberately built to be
imperceptible. ⚠️ **That vocabulary was not free:** IMP-077 added `react-native-reanimated` and
`react-native-worklets` as **native** deps and forced the vc14 build. **This parked row is the only thing
that ever makes that cost worth paying.**

⚠️ **`stagger` is unused — do not be fooled by `Animated.stagger` in
[`Celebration.js:23`](../src/screens/Celebration.js#L23).** That is React Native's own `Animated` API, a
different function entirely. An audit on 2026-09-10 initially miscounted it as a consumer.

**Where to start when it unparks.** `riseIn` on cards and rows is the default entrance the module was
written around; `popIn` on rewards and badges is generalized from `Celebration.js`, which is the house
motion. ⚠️ **`art.js`, `Celebration.js` and `Toast.js` stay on the RN `Animated` API — coexistence is the
design, not a compromise. Do not port them** ([`motion.js:16`](../src/motion.js#L16)).

**The gate.** "Plus is complete" is the owner's phrase and the owner's call. At minimum that means the
open Plus rows (IMP-108, IMP-109, IMP-110) shipped and WALK-19 finished.
